JavaScript supports various types of operators that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. Here are some of the most commonly used operators in JavaScript:

### Arithmetic Operators:

- **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
- **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first operand.
- **Multiplication (\*)**: Multiplies two operands.
- **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second operand.
- **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of dividing the first operand by the second operand.
- **Increment (++)**: Increases the value of a variable by 1.
- **Decrement (--)**: Decreases the value of a variable by 1.

### Assignment Operators:

- **Assignment (=)**: Assigns a value to a variable.
- **Addition Assignment (+=)**: Adds the value of the right operand to the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Subtraction Assignment (-=)**: Subtracts the value of the right operand from the variable and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Multiplication Assignment (\*=)**: Multiplies the variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.
- **Division Assignment (/=)**: Divides the variable by the value of the right operand and assigns the result to the variable.

### Comparison Operators:

- **Equal to (==)**: Checks if two operands are equal.
- **Not Equal to (!=)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.
- **Strict Equal to (===)**: Checks if two operands are equal and of the same type.
- **Strict Not Equal to (!==)**: Checks if two operands are not equal and of the same type.
- **Greater than (>)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second operand.
- **Less than (<)**: Checks if the first operand is less than the second operand.
- **Greater than or Equal to (>=)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second operand.
- **Less than or Equal to (<=)**: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second operand.

### Logical Operators:

- **Logical AND (&&)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
- **Logical OR (||)**: Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
- **Logical NOT (!)**: Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa.

### Other Operators:

- **Conditional (ternary) Operator (? : )**: Evaluates a condition and returns one of two expressions depending on whether the condition is true or false.
- **typeof Operator**: Returns the data type of its operand.
- **instanceof Operator**: Returns true if the specified object is an instance of the specified object type.
